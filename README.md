Music in the abc notation scheme

Mostly traditional fiddle music,  but also an eclectic olio of
things I've been playing on guitar and/or harmonica and music my
wife has played on violin or taught to her students.

The `.abc` files can be turned into PostScript or PDF sheet music
using `abcm2ps`,  and/or turned into admittedly not very musical
MIDI files using `abc2midi`.  The latter are still useful if you're
trying to learn a new tune.

I'm putting this on GitHub to take advantage of version control/history,
not because I think it'll be tremendously useful to anyone.
