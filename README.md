Music in the abc notation scheme
Mostly traditional fiddle music,  but also an eclectic olio of things I've been playing on guitar and/or harmonica and music my wife has played on violin or taught to her students.
I'm moving it to GitHub to take advantage of version control/history,  not because I think it'll be tremendously useful to anyone.
